# Automatic Debugger
Implement an automatic debugging tool based on the delta-debugging technique.
Given a buggy version and a correct version of a program with a list of changes in between, delta-debuggying systematically search for the changes to identify in which change(s) introducing the bug.
Used python to implement the basic delta-debugging technique specified under Algorithm 1 in the paper "Yesterday, my program worked. Today, it does not. Why?"

* project3_automatic_debugger.pdf contains the instruction and description of the project.
* README.txt is the report for the project. It contains using instruction, my finding and thinking of the project.
