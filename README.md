# Automatic Debugger
Implement an automatic debugging tool based on the delta-debugging technique.
Given a buggy version and a correct version of a program with a list of changes in between, delta-debuggying systematically search for the changes to identify in which change(s) introducing the bug.
Used python to implement the basic delta-debugging technique specified under Algorithm 1 in the paper "Yesterday, my program worked. Today, it does not. Why?
